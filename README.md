phishing

This repository contains the analysis of a suspicious Bank of America-themed email.

Phishing Indicators

Sender Spoofing: From security@bankofamerica-secure.com (fake domain).

Reply-To Mismatch: Replies directed to secure-team@boa-support.net, not the official domain.

Urgent Language: “Verify your account immediately” and “Failure to confirm within 12 hours will result in account suspension” → pressure tactic.

Suspicious Link: https://bankofamerica.secure-update-login.com/verify → not the official Bank of America website.

Generic Greeting: Uses “Dear Customer” instead of addressing the user by name.

Conclusion

The email is confirmed as phishing. It attempts to steal Bank of America account credentials by creating a false sense of urgency and using fraudulent links. Users should not click the links or provide any personal information.
